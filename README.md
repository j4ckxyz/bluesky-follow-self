# Bluesky Self-Follow Tool

A simple Python script that lets you follow your own account on Bluesky/ATProto.

## What it does

• **Self-Follow**: Creates a follow relationship from your Bluesky account to itself (yes, this is actually possible on ATProto!)
• **Multi-Account Support**: Lets you repeat the process for multiple accounts in one session

## Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/j4ckxyz/bluesky-follow-self.git
cd bluesky-follow-self
```

If you don't have Python installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Next, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

The script will guide you through the process - just have your Bluesky handle and an app password ready!
